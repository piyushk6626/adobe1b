  "details": "#### Primary Objective:\nRetrieve all critical information related to the structural integrity, building systems, safety features, regulatory compliance, and maintenance history of commercial properties to identify defects and assess overall condition.\n\n#### Core Information to Retrieve:\n-   **Structural Components:** Foundation types, concrete specifications, steel frameworks, load-bearing walls, truss systems, columns, beams, signs of cracking, spalling, settling, or bowing.\n-   **Roofing Systems:** Flat roofs (TPO, EPDM, built-up), pitched roofs (metal, shingle, tile for commercial applications), roof access points, drainage systems, skylights, signs of leaks, membrane damage, flashing details, warranty information.\n-   **HVAC Systems:** Commercial-grade units, chillers, boilers, cooling towers, ductwork, ventilation systems, thermostat controls, energy efficiency ratings, maintenance logs, filter types, air quality reports, exhaust systems (especially for kitchens, labs).\n-   **Electrical Systems:** Main service panels (amperage, voltage, phases), wiring diagrams, conduit types, circuit breakers, emergency lighting, standby generators, fire alarm systems, data wiring, GFCI/AFCI requirements, grounding, lighting systems (interior/exterior), sub-panels.\n-   **Plumbing Systems:** Water supply lines, drainage pipes, hot water heaters (commercial capacity), backflow prevention devices, grease traps, floor drains, sprinkler system connections, sewer lines, fixture counts, water pressure.\n-   **Fire Protection & Life Safety:** Sprinkler system layouts and inspection tags, fire alarm panels, smoke detectors, emergency exits, exit lighting, fire doors, standpipes, fire suppression systems (e.g., clean agent systems), occupancy load limits, NFPA code references.\n-   **Accessibility (ADA Compliance):** Ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms, clear path of travel, doorway widths, signage, parking space dimensions.\n-   **Building Envelope:** Exterior walls (masonry, EIFS, glass curtain walls), windows, doors (commercial entry, overhead doors), insulation, vapor barriers, caulking, flashing, signs of moisture intrusion.\n-   **Site Features:** Parking lot condition, storm drainage, retaining walls, sidewalks, landscaping, utility connections (gas, water, sewer, electrical entry), outdoor lighting.\n-   **Environmental Concerns:** Presence of asbestos, lead-based paint, mold, radon, underground storage tanks (USTs), hazardous material storage, Phase I/II Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs), air quality testing results.\n-   **Documentation & Regulations:** Building permits, certificates of occupancy, as-built drawings, blueprints, previous inspection reports, maintenance contracts, equipment specifications, warranty documents, local building codes (e.g., IBC), zoning ordinances, fire department reports.\n-   **Interior Finishes:** Floor coverings, wall finishes, ceiling types (acoustic tile, gypsum board), partitions, signs of wear, damage, or water intrusion.\n-   **Vertical Transportation:** Elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters â€“ inspection certificates, maintenance records, load capacities, safety features.\n\n#### Information to Ignore (Noise):\n-   Detailed residential-specific information (e.g., single-family home mortgage rates, school district performance, residential appliance manuals).\n-   Tenant lease agreements or financial statements unrelated to property maintenance.\n-   Marketing materials for products or services irrelevant to property inspection (e.g., investment banking, personal finance).\n-   Highly specialized industrial manufacturing processes or equipment specifications unrelated to the building's core systems.\n-   Generic news articles or publications not directly related to commercial real estate, building codes, or construction.\n-   Personal documents or employee records.\n-   Architectural design aesthetics or interior decorating schemes that do not impact safety or functionality."
