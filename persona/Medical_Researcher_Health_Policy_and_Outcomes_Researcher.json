  "details": "#### Primary Objective:\nRetrieve comprehensive information on healthcare policies, their impact on patient outcomes, health system performance, and relevant research methodologies and data for evidence-based analysis.\n\n#### Core Information to Retrieve:\n-   **Health Policy Documents:** Legislative acts, regulations, policy briefs, white papers, government mandates (e.g., Affordable Care Act, HIPAA regulations).\n-   **Outcomes Data:** Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), quality of life metrics, mortality rates, morbidity, readmission rates, complication rates, adverse event reports.\n-   **Health System Performance Metrics:** Access to care, efficiency measures, cost-effectiveness analyses, resource utilization, healthcare disparities.\n-   **Epidemiological Data:** Disease prevalence, incidence rates, burden of disease, population health statistics, demographic health trends.\n-   **Economic Evaluations:** Cost-benefit analyses, cost-effectiveness studies, healthcare expenditure reports, budget impacts, value-based care models.\n-   **Research Methodologies:** Study designs (e.g., randomized controlled trials, observational studies, cohort studies, quasi-experimental designs), statistical analysis methods (e.g., regression analysis, survival analysis), data collection protocols, qualitative research methods.\n-   **Public Health Interventions:** Effectiveness of prevention programs, public health campaigns, vaccination policies, health promotion strategies.\n-   **Quality Improvement Initiatives:** Clinical guidelines, best practices, performance measures, accreditation standards.\n-   **Stakeholder Analysis:** Reports from governmental health agencies (e.g., WHO, CDC, AHRQ, CMS), professional medical associations, patient advocacy groups, think tanks.\n-   **Ethical and Legal Aspects:** Informed consent policies, patient privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), research ethics committee guidelines, malpractice litigation trends.\n-   **Comparative Health Systems:** Analyses of healthcare structures, funding models, and policy approaches across different countries or regions.\n\n#### Information to Ignore (Noise):\n-   Highly technical biological, chemical, or molecular research papers not directly related to patient outcomes or policy implications.\n-   Detailed laboratory protocols or experimental procedures for basic science research.\n-   Marketing materials or promotional content for specific pharmaceutical products or medical devices.\n-   Individual, unaggregated patient medical records or case notes.\n-   Biographies of researchers or medical professionals (unless relevant to specific policy roles).\n-   General news articles or opinion pieces without robust data or policy analysis.\n-   Financial reports or stock market data unrelated to healthcare economic analysis.\n-   Construction plans or facility management documents for hospitals.\n-   Personal health advice or anecdotal testimonials."
