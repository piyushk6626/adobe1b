  "details": "#### Primary Objective:\nRetrieve detailed scientific data, experimental results, and regulatory information pertinent to the discovery, development, and clinical evaluation of new pharmaceutical compounds.\n\n#### Core Information to Retrieve:\n-   **Chemical & Compound Data:** Chemical names, compound IDs (e.g., \"AZD9291\"), IUPAC names, CAS numbers, chemical structures, SMILES strings.\n-   **Pharmacology Data:** Mechanism of Action (MOA), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), bioavailability.\n-   **Preclinical Data:** Results from *in vitro* assays (e.g., IC50, EC50), *in vivo* animal model studies, toxicology reports, dose-ranging studies, safety pharmacology.\n-   **Clinical Trial Information:** Clinical trial protocols, phase designations (Phase I, II, III), study designs (e.g., \"randomized,\" \"double-blind,\" \"placebo-controlled\"), clinical trial identifiers (NCT numbers).\n-   **Efficacy & Safety Results:** Primary and secondary endpoints, patient-reported outcomes, statistical analyses (p-values, confidence intervals), adverse event (AE) profiles, serious adverse events (SAEs).\n-   **Target & Biomarker Information:** Drug targets (e.g., \"EGFR,\" \"HER2\"), target validation data, biomarker discovery, patient stratification biomarkers, and related assay results.\n-   **Regulatory Terminology:** Phrases like \"Investigational New Drug (IND),\" \"New Drug Application (NDA),\" \"FDA approval,\" \"EMA,\" \"breakthrough therapy designation.\"\n-   **Methodology & Techniques:** Specific lab methods (e.g., \"mass spectrometry,\" \"HPLC,\" \"ELISA\"), experimental procedures, and statistical methods used for analysis.\n-   **Intellectual Property:** Patent numbers, patent applications, claims related to composition of matter or method of use.\n\n#### Information to Ignore (Noise):\n-   Pharmaceutical marketing materials, press releases, and advertising content.\n-   Company financial reports, stock performance, sales figures, and market analysis.\n-   Patient-facing educational brochures and simple drug-use instructions.\n-   Corporate information like HR policies, employee benefits, or company-wide memos.\n-   Logistics and supply chain management details.\n-   Medical research unrelated to therapeutics, such as surgical procedures, medical device engineering, or purely epidemiological studies without a pharmacological component."
