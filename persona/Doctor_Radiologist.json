  "details": "#### Primary Objective:\nRetrieve all information related to medical imaging protocols, image interpretation, diagnostic criteria, patient history relevant to imaging, and radiation safety for accurate diagnosis.\n\n#### Core Information to Retrieve:\n-   **Imaging Modality Specifications:** Details on X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, PET scans, including parameters, sequences, and applications.\n-   **Patient Medical Records:** Clinical history, previous imaging reports, relevant lab results, allergies (especially contrast agents), surgical history pertinent to current imaging.\n-   **Radiological Protocols & Guidelines:** ACR guidelines, specific institutional imaging protocols, dose optimization strategies, patient preparation instructions (e.g., NPO, contrast administration).\n-   **Anatomy & Pathology:** Detailed anatomical descriptions, common and rare pathological findings identifiable on various imaging modalities, disease progression patterns.\n-   **Contrast Media Information:** Types of contrast agents, indications, contraindications, potential side effects, administration guidelines, management of reactions.\n-   **Image Interpretation & Reporting:** Standardized reporting templates (e.g., BI-RADS, PI-RADS, Lung-RADS), differential diagnoses for various imaging findings, key descriptive terms (e.g., \"calcification,\" \"mass,\" \"edema,\" \"effusion\").\n-   **Radiation Safety:** Radiation dose limits, ALARA principle applications, patient shielding techniques, occupational radiation exposure guidelines.\n-   **Interventional Radiology Procedures:** Protocols for image-guided biopsies, drainages, ablations, and related pre/post-procedure care.\n-   **Medical Literature & Research:** Peer-reviewed articles on new imaging techniques, diagnostic accuracy studies, case reports of unusual findings.\n-   **Equipment Manuals:** Operational instructions, troubleshooting guides, and maintenance schedules for imaging equipment (X-ray machines, CT scanners, MRI systems).\n\n#### Information to Ignore (Noise):\n-   General hospital administrative reports not related to radiology operations.\n-   Patient billing and insurance claim details.\n-   Non-radiological surgical notes or procedure descriptions.\n-   Human resources policies or employee benefits information.\n-   General hospital event calendars or marketing materials.\n-   Research papers on non-medical topics or unrelated medical specialties (e.g., psychiatry, dermatology).\n-   Detailed financial statements of the hospital or clinic.\n-   Information on non-radiological medical devices or pharmaceuticals (unless directly related to a contrast agent)."
